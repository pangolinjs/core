/* EMBED RESPONSIVE
 *
 * For use with media embeds – such as videos, slideshows,
 * or even images – that need to retain a specific aspect
 * ratio but adapt to the width of their containing element.
 *
 * Default aspect ratio is 1:1. Change this by applying
 * modifier classes.
 *
 * Usage:
 * <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive--16by9">
 *  <video class="embed-responsive__content">
 *    <source src="http://distribution.bbb3d.renderfarming.net/video/mp4/bbb_sunflower_1080p_30fps_normal.mp4" type="video/mp4">
 *    <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 Video.</p>
 *  </video>
 * </div>
